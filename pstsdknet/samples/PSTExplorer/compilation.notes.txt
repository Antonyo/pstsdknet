PSTExplorer Compilation Notes
----------------------------------------

Added dependency on DotNetOpenMail to support export to EML format... 

Downloaded from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/dotnetopenmail/files/dotnetopenmail/0.5.8b/DotNetOpenMail-0.5.8b-src.zip/download

I had to make some changes to enable proper saving... the DotNetOpenMail project was
the only open source .Net native MIME library I could find that would write a EML (as
opposed to parsing it). Unfortunately it seems the project has mostly been abandoned
by it's maintainers, so I choose to include the source here, rather than attempting to 
patch back to the main project. 

We'll resolve this at a later time.

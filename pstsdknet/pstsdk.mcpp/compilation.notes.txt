Expected Locations of Dependencies
----------------------------------------

To correctly compile this project you must first download the source code 
for those projects and place the code in the appropriate locations. 

Here's an example folder structure, assuming a root directory called 
"C:\code", starting with the location of this file, and showing you 
the expected relative locations of various other files :

  C:\code\pstsdknet\trunk\pstsdk.mcpp\compilation.notes.txt
  C:\code\pstsdknet\trunk\pstsdk.definition\pstsdk.definition.csproj
  C:\code\pstsdk\fairport\trunk\pstsdk\compiler_notes.txt
  C:\code\boost_1_42_0\README.TXT

Assuming all these files and folders are in the correct location, the code should compile. This has been tested in Visual Studio 2008 only. YMMV with anything else.
